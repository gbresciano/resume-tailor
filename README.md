# Resume Tailoring — Claude Project Setup Guide

This folder contains everything you need to set up a Claude Project that
generates ATS-optimised, tailored resumes from a single source of truth.

---

## Architecture: Generic vs. Personal Layer

The project is split into two layers so it can be adapted for different people without rewriting the prompt logic:

- **Generic layer** (works for anyone): `project-instructions.md`, `writing-preferences.md`, `resume-template.md`
- **Personal layer** (one person's identity + history): `personal-profile.md`, `master-resume.md`

To adapt this project for a different person, edit only the **Personal layer**. The generic layer references the personal layer through soft references (e.g. "see `personal-profile.md` for the resume title set") and works as-is.

## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a new Claude Project

Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) → **Projects** → **New Project**.
Name it something like: `Resume Tailoring — [Your Name]`

### 2. Add the Project Instructions

- Open the project → **Edit Project Instructions**
- Open `project-instructions.md` and paste the entire contents in
- Save

### 3. Upload the four knowledge files

Inside the project, click **Add content** (or the paperclip/upload icon):

- Upload `master-resume.md` — verified career data
- Upload `personal-profile.md` — identity, positioning, accuracy constraints
- Upload `writing-preferences.md` — tone, verbs, format
- Upload `resume-template.md` — structural scaffold

Claude will have persistent access to all four files across every conversation in this project.

## How To Use The Project

### Basic usage

Start a new chat inside the project and paste in a job description:

> "Here's a JD for a Senior PM role at Notion. Can you tailor my resume for it?"

Claude will:

1. Analyse the JD, extract the keyword list, and assess fit
2. State the positioning angle it's using
3. Generate a complete tailored resume (ready to download as `.docx`)
4. Provide tailoring notes — targeted keywords, ATS match estimate, decisions

### Iterating on a resume

After the first output, you can refine:

- "Make the summary shorter and more direct"
- "Emphasise the engineering side more — this is a founding role"
- "Remove the ASOS entry and give Crikle more space"
- "The JD mentions Figma a lot — can you surface the design skills more?"

### Checking fit before tailoring

You can also ask Claude to assess fit before generating a full resume:

- "Read this JD and tell me how strong a fit I am before we write anything"

## Forking For Your Own Use

To adapt this project for a different person:

1. **Replace `master-resume.md`** with the new person's career data. Keep the same structure (per-role `Responsibilities`, `Notable developments`, `Key achievements`, `Verified metrics`, `AI scope`, `Accuracy note` where applicable).
2. **Rewrite `personal-profile.md`** for the new person:
   - **Core Positioning Statement** — one sentence describing how they pitch themselves
   - **What You Are NOT** — framings to refuse even when invited (e.g. for an IC engineer who isn't a manager, list "people leader" here)
   - **Resume Title — Fixed Set** — the canonical titles they're willing to use (e.g. a designer might use "Senior Product Designer / Staff Product Designer / Design Lead")
   - **AI Scope — Conservative Register** — only if they have *some* AI exposure that's been overclaimed by past resumes; otherwise remove this section
   - **Cross-Cutting Accuracy Constraints** — domain-specific overclaim guards (e.g. "no full-stack claims if the experience was frontend-only")
3. **Leave the generic files alone** — `project-instructions.md`, `writing-preferences.md`, and `resume-template.md` work as-is.
4. **Update `resume-template.md` contact line** with the new person's contact info.

The generic files reference the personal files by name. As long as the personal files exist and follow the same section structure, the prompt logic continues to work.

## Keeping The Source of Truth Up To Date

Files have different update cadences — treat them separately:

**`master-resume.md`** — update when career facts change: new role, confirmed metric, new tech used, new responsibility. Rare and deliberate.

**`personal-profile.md`** — update when positioning evolves: a new "what you are not" framing surfaces, AI scope expands, you decide to drop a title from the fixed set. Occasional.

**`writing-preferences.md`** — update if your editorial preferences drift (verb register, common mistakes you keep noticing). Rare.

**`resume-template.md`** — update for format-only changes (margins, font preferences). Rare.

To update any file: edit it locally, delete the old version from the Claude Project, and re-upload. Changes made only inside a conversation do not persist.

## Tips For Best Results

- **Paste the full JD**, not just the title. The more signal Claude has, the better the keyword extraction and tailoring.
- **Include the company name** — Claude may use it to frame industry context.
- **Tell Claude the seniority level** if it's unclear from the JD — it drives the title pick from the fixed set.
- **Ask for a cover letter** in the same conversation — Claude will use the same tailoring decisions consistently.
